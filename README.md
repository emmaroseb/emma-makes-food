Hi everyone! One of my favorite things to do during my free time is make food! Even when I might be stressed for quarter finals at school, or just bored at home, I usually end up making some type of food (even if it's not 100% edible). On this page, I will be showing you some of my favorite foods to make or bake, along with some tips.

## The Perfect _Fluffy_ Scrambled Eggs

When making scrambled eggs, you'll always want to start off with some key ingredients: **2 or 3 eggs, butter, and a medium sized pan.** I learned this recipe from a youtube video a few years ago and found it to be one of the best. If you'd like to see how Chef Gordon Ramsay cooks his scrambled eggs, a secret page could take you there. I follow a secret page on an app that allows you to view paid articles from celebrities for free.

**Cooking Your Eggs**
Now, off to actually creating. Coat the pan in a light layer of butter to prevent the eggs from sticking. Scramble your eggs in a bowl and pour it in. Let the eggs settle until you see it beginning to cook along the edges. Using a spatula, drag the eggs in from the outside to the inside, simply pulling only parts of it while it is still liquid. Continue doing so as it cooks. Once the eggs are cooked, flip it around to cook all aread of the egg. You have now finished cooking your scrambled eggs.

**Tasty Additions**
When cooking eggs for someone other than yourself, representation can be everything. It could make or break the dish if it is brought out looking unwell even if it tastes well. You could choose to season the eggs with a hint of salt while it is cooking. I find <strong>furikake</strong> to be a great addition when eating it with rice. The furikake ties in the eggs and rice with its salt, seaweed, and sesame seeds. Now that you are done making your eggs, simply put it on a plate and you are ready too serve it.

Now, we all know the famous chef Gordon Ramsay. So it wouldn't be a bad idea to watch some of his videos on how to cook a simple breakfast meal. Even though this short article is about my way to make fluffy scrambled eggs, I suggest you also take a look at [Chef Ramsay's Scrambled Eggs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUP7U5vTMM0) video to get a different feel of things. His way of cooking eggs has more toppings to it, which you could always adjust to your liking. Anyways... thanks for reading, and happy cooking!
